# Fix ignored matrix-commander devices automatically.
# Scans all pipe stores. Devices of users that are still members of a room on
# this server are removed from the nio ignored_devices lists. Ignoring a device
# of an active member blocks m.room_key sharing and makes that user unable to
# decrypt messages. Stale devices (users no longer in any room) are left
# untouched.
# After a change the single pipes-runner container (project pipelistener,
# service matrix.pipes-runner) is restarted so the change takes effect.
# Run via cron (see matrix.yml) or manually.
# Deployed via Ansible (matrix.yml) as a standalone script under files/.
# Host-agnostic: uses $(hostname) instead of an inventory host variable.
