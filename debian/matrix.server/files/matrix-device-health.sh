# matrix-device-health.sh - E2EE device health watchdog for all room stores.
#
# nio marks a member device as "deleted" when it is missing from the
# homeserver's device-key response during sync (e.g. after the federation
# key cache was lost). Deleted devices are excluded from megolm key
# sharing, so that user can no longer decrypt new messages.
#
# This script checks every deleted device in every runner store against
# the homeserver (POST /keys/query, which also re-primes an empty
# federation key cache) and unmarks devices that still exist on the
# server. After changes the single pipes-runner container is restarted
# so the stores are reloaded.
#
# Run via cron (see matrix.yml) or manually:
#   /usr/local/sbin/matrix-device-health.sh
